excerpt: 'We consider the problem of video caching across a set of 5G small-cell base stations (SBS) connected to each other over a high-capacity short-delay back-haul link, and linked to a remote server over a long-delay connection. Even though the problem of minimizing the overall video delivery delay is NP-hard, the Collaborative Caching Algorithm (CCA) that we present can efficiently compute a solution close to the optimal, where the degree of sub-optimality depends on the worst case video-to-cache size ratio. The algorithm is naturally amenable to distributed implementation that requires no explicit coordination between the SBSs, and runs in O(N + K log K) time, where N is the number of SBSs (caches) and K the maximum number of videos. We extend CCA to an online setting where the video popularities are not known a priori but are estimated over time through a limited amount of periodic information sharing between the SBSs. We demonstrate that our algorithm closely approaches the optimal integral caching solution as the cache size increases. Moreover, via simulations carried out on real video access traces, we show that our algorithm effectively uses the SBS caches to reduce the video delivery delay and conserve the remote serverâ€™s bandwidth, and that it outperforms two other reference caching methods adapted to our system setting.'
